			<h2>1. MEET THE TARWEEDS</h2>

			<p>There’s a super-rare plant out there called the Livermore tarweed. <em>Why would anyone care about a plant called Livermore tarweed</em>? is a reasonable question you might ask. The plant is irredeemably drab. Its flowers are pedestrian. It smells of paint-thinner, and its hairy stems bear a sticky resin that, in the unlikely event of your walking through a field of Livermore tarweeds, would accompany your pants home. Sheep are rumored to rub their faces in tarweed to detox. But even cows won’t eat it.</p>

			<p>There are three known populations of Livermore tarweed on earth. All three live within a few miles of each other in the Livermore Valley, a narrow east-west crease in the Diablo range on the boundary between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley. A botanist named Heath Bartosh recently spent 300 hours over three years combing the valley and nearby foothills for more, but didn’t find any. While he was searching, a road was built over one of the populated fields, destroying the plants there. A figure-eight-shaped BMX course appeared in the middle of another field.</p>

			<p>If a Livermore tarweed sprouted in your garden, you’d pull it. Since it grows in the wild -- or at least, in an undeveloped field in the suburbs -- it is much easier to ignore it. Which is precisely what the vast majority of people, me included, have done. “We protect what we love,” Jacques Cousteau said, which is a handy reminder that if you rely on people to protect you it’s advantageous to be born lovely. In the not-improbable case that the unlovely Livermore tarweed goes extinct, how much could you say it was the plant’s own fault?</p>

			<p>Heath Bartosh, a friend to underdogs, loves the Livermore tarweed. A few months ago, he took me to view the plant’s largest remaining population. We met in a dry field in the Livermore Valley, amidst the withered carcasses of annual grasses, on the edge of a dusty alkali scald. The sun blazed on a 105-degree day. The encroaching arms of suburban development marched out of a brown haze hanging on the horizon, while morning commuters crawled westward on Interstate 580. An orange fence shimmered in the distance, marking the boundaries of a former landfill. Everywhere at knee height were the unspectacular yellow dots of the Livermore tarweed in bloom. “It’s got a little public opinion problem because it’s not a healthy forest,” Bartosh had warned me in advance.</p>

			<p>Bartosh wore jeans, boots, and a cherry red floral-print long-sleeve shirt. His head, neatly shaved and bare, radiated the hot sunshine. He has spent a lot of time in this particular field and he introduced it to me enthusiastically. “I like to refer to this as a poor man’s Carrizo Plain,” he said, referring to the national monument that explodes with wildflower fireworks and rare animals every spring. “You just don’t have the antelopes and the sandhill cranes and stuff. But you have at least a lot of the same genus of plants.”</p>

			<p>One year ago, Bartosh petitioned the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to protect the Livermore tarweed under the state’s endangered species act. This was more audacious a request than I had realized: the state of California has not added a plant to its endangered species list since 2007. Only six plants have made it onto the state list in the 21st century, and you have to go back to 2002 to find the last time the state listed a plant that wasn’t already on the federal Endangered Species Act.</p>

			<p>Livermore tarweed champions like Bartosh consider it both a keystone species and, through this petition, a representative for all the neglected common folk of the botanical world. It makes a nice Cinderella story: a rare and unappreciated plant and its band of rag-tag allies wins the acceptance of the wider world. (“‘Rare Plants, Rare People,’” Bartosh told me. “You’ve got a lot of weirdos out there in the plant world, for sure.”)</p>

			<p>The tarweed needs a story if people are going to learn to love it and protect it. But fairy tale isn’t the right genre. In the fairy tale, Cinderella is beautiful all along. The ugly duckling turns into a swan. The frog becomes a prince. The audience is always aware of the hero’s true worth; the tension is just whether the other characters will figure it out, too. The Livermore tarweed is not Cinderella. It desires no change. It desires no appreciation. “Happily ever after,” in this case, means the faithful replication of its own ugliness.</p>

			<h2>2. HEROIC TARWEEDS</h2>

			<div class="conversation">

				<p><em>Livermore tarweed: I exist! I am the hero of my own story!</em></p>

				<p><em>Universe: Have we met?</em></p>

			</div>

			<p>A problem you run into right away in telling stories about plants is that they’re really quite difficult to anthropomorphize. The tree, now, is a botanical protagonist a person can comprehend. You’re an individual, you’re tall, and things move slowly, which is how JRR Tolkein imagined the Ents in The Lord of the Rings, or how Ursula K. Leguin imagined her heroic oak tree in The Direction of the Road. “The ancient trees,” Zach St. George wrote recently in <em>Guernica</em>, “always seem to inspire this measuring of their lives against ours.”</p>

			<p>The annual plant particularly resists such empathy. Individuals don’t matter; by design annual plants are expendables. Livermore tarweeds have been flowering and dying and re-growing and flowering and dying and re-growing in their field for millennia. (Of course, trees do this too on their own time, and if you wanted, you could imagine the ancient sequoias as just groups of weeds that grow up and die and grow up and die on a longer timescale, but that’s not really how we think about it, is it?)</p>

			<p>As a population, nonetheless, this patch of Livermore tarweed exists on a fairly staggering time scale. Mount Diablo grew from nothing behind it, the San Francisco Bay flooded and receded and flooded, people arrived, and arrived again with cows, and meanwhile thousands of generations of Livermore tarweed bloomed. These tarweeds exist as a process, a waveform. We’re a storytelling species that needs to pin some identifiable quality on the species we protect; the tarweed, again, refuses. You might as well try to anthropomorphize the tides.</p>

			<h2>3. FRIENDLY TARWEEDS</h2>

			<div class="conversation">
				<p><em>Livermore tarweed: The critics love me!</em></p>

				<p><em>Universe: No one likes the critics.</em></p>
			</div>

			<p>As a survival strategy in an era defined by people’s influence on the world, dying every year is ineffective. But some annual plants, barred from heroic individualism, have effectively adopted a more communitarian role. The reproductive fitness of tropical milkweed, you might say, has benefited dramatically from the plant’s relationship with the monarch butterfly. People love the monarch, so they plant the milkweed (even when they’re not supposed to). The Livermore tarweed has important relationships with insects, too. Alas, none of them are the charismatic monarch. If the plant goes extinct, you might blame its insect friends, too.</p>

			<p>The tarweed is probably pollinated by a species of moth in the genus <em>Heliothodes</em>. No one has actually been able to find or name the moth. If the Livermore tarweed goes extinct no one ever will. One of Charles Darwin’s famous validated predictions was that scientists would find a moth with a pollinating proboscis to match a uniquely shaped Madagascar orchid; there is a very similar potential story happening right here, and how exciting you find it is probably only dependent on how much psychological baggage you have about tarweeds not being orchids and Livermore not being Madagascar.</p>

			<p>The tarweed is also a host for predatory insects like assassin bugs. Several years ago, a UC Davis graduate student named Billy Krimmel looked closely at common tarweed and saw a lot of dead insects -- “carrion” -- stuck to the plant. He wondered how all these dead bugs might benefit the plant, so he went through the trash cans at the UC Davis fruit fly lab, and collected a bunch of dead fruit flies, and then stuck the fruit flies to plants, and kept track of what happened. What happened was the plants with the dead flies on them quickly grew into massive, thriving bug cities. Most of the new bugs were predators, and in addition to eating the fruit flies they were eating up all the herbivorous biting pests that might bother a plant. Krimmel had an idea that maybe the plant was doing this on purpose. Its sticky hairs were serving as a “tourist trap,” he says, for all kinds of insects, and the carrion was attracting predators that would stick around to clean up any undesirables that were left over. Some predators had clearly evolved with specific sticky plants, because they had specific adaptations to help prevent getting stuck themselves. This study became Krimmel’s PhD thesis, and a foundation for his enduring respect for the tarweed plants. “It’s so <em>intricate</em>,” he said. “That’s what brought me to the whole thing, these intricate stories you can miss if you’re not paying attention.”</p>

			<p>Krimmel, who now runs a native plant landscaping business out of Davis, is one of a handful of humans who is excited to play the gene-spreading role for tarweed. He encourages clients to plant <em>Madia elegans</em>, a tarweed known as common madia. He agrees it’s a tough sell for a homeowner worried about what the neighbors will think. So the argument he’s settled on is, “A plant can be more than a decoration. It can have function.”</p>

			<p>Krimmel’s tolerant definition of “function” encompasses a range of answers, from “it has fruit to eat” to “it reminds me of my grandmother.” But there’s no mistaking, he says, the wide variety of services a tarweed can provide. “Tarweed has been valued by wildlife for millions of years,” he wrote <a href="http://www.restorationlandscaping.com/bugscape-blog/2015/4/20/growing-tarweeds-from-seed">in a blog post</a> in which he explains how to grow common tarweed from seed. “It was a staple to the Pomo Indians, who ate its seeds for protein. Tarweeds are immensely drought-tolerant, beautiful, smell lovely, provide natural, chemical-free pest control, feed birds, protect pollinators, and much more. And yet, thanks to an unfortunate name, they get no respect.”</p>

			<p>Why even call it a weed in the first place, Kimmel wants to know. Just because it grows in the wild? And furthermore, he says, tarweeds don’t smell like tar to him. “I describe it as more a buttery lemon smell,” he says. “The name is derogatory.”</p>

			<h2>4. SMELLY TARWEEDS</h2>

			<div class="conversation">
				<p><em>Livermore tarweed: I am mysterious!</em></p>

				<p><em>Universe: I prefer Agatha Christie.</em></p>
			</div>

			<p>It occurs to me that perhaps the best conservation case for a person is to tell a story about people that draws the Livermore tarweed in and makes it necessary. And so, a brief note here on the quest to define the limitations of the human sense of smell. Fascinating new science suggests that we are incapable of accurately describing new sensory experiences, like new tastes or new smells. Whether this is a perception problem -- we can’t distinguish smells or tastes (or even emotions) very accurately -- or a linguistic problem -- we perceive but cannot translate into words -- is an unsolved mystery.</p>

			<p>Edward Lee Greene, the first botanist on the faculty at UC Berkeley, rearranged the family tree of the tarweeds by the aroma of their resins. Among other inventions he created a genus he called <em>Deinandra</em> for a group of like-smelling tarweeds. Since his classification made no sense to the eye it was mostly rejected until many decades later, when DNA techniques allowed botanists like Jepson Herbarium Curator Bruce Baldwin to prove that Greene had been mostly correct. Baldwin resurrected the <em>Deinandra</em> name, which is now the largest single genus of tarweeds.</p>

			<p>A few months ago, as I stood amongst the tarweeds with Heath Bartosh and three native plant experts from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, I asked them to describe the particular smell of the Livermore tarweed.</p>

			<p>“That’s a tough one,” Bartosh said. “It’s, um, I dunno. In terms of other tarweeds, it’s more bright.”</p>

			<p>“That one,” CDFW environmental scientist Cherilyn Burton said, pointing to a more common tarweed also flowering in the field, “has, like, a mintier smell? This is more herbal or something.”</p>

			<p>“There’s a fire-following plant on Mount Diablo that comes out in force called whispering bells,” Bartosh said, addressing the larger philosophical problem. “I couldn’t put a phrase or a word on that smell. Somebody we were working with was like, ‘It smells like wet balloon.’ That’s it! It smells like wet balloon!”</p>

			<p>How to describe the aroma of the Livermore tarweed has tormented me. Chemically, the aroma comes from a variety of volatile organic compounds like turpenes and pinenes. Since those are also emitted by pine trees, and particularly pine sap, there is obviously a suggestion of pine. Turpenes can be distilled into turpentine, so there is more than a hint of paint-thinner. Tarweeds emit camphene, which Wikipedia describes as “pungent.”</p>

			<p>Perhaps there is a touch of lemon. Butter would not also occur to me, but I have a subjective view of the universe. However you describe the Livermore tarweed’s aroma, it is unique. If one aspect to biodiversity loss is the “extinction of experience,” as Robert Michael Pyle first put it, the loss of the Livermore tarweed would leave the world with just slightly poorer an olfactory landscape. It would rob us of a stage prop in the story about ourselves.</p>

			<h2>5. DISPLACED TARWEEDS</h2>

			<div class="conversation">
				<p><em>Livermore tarweed: I have hidden depths! Universe: I don’t own a microscope. Also I like extroverts.</em></p>
			</div>

			<p>On any California hike you take the vast majority of the plants you see will have been introduced by people in the last few hundred years. The Livermore tarweed story is plenty familiar in this context: it’s a victim imperiled because California is where people come from around the world to build their own dreamscape, and the Livermore tarweed is inherited furniture. For native plant defenders this version of the narrative is a tragedy -- but the tragedy is ours, too; we might realize too late that the furniture was uniquely suited to the setting. It’s the parable with which Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich opens his book <em>Extinction</em>: species are like the rivets in an airplane, and you can’t know whether a single extinction is the loss that finally causes the wing to fall off:</p>

			<p><em>A dozen rivets, or a dozen species, might never be missed. On the other hand, a thirteenth rivet popped from a wing flap, or the extinction of a key species involved in the cycling of nitrogen, could lead to a serious accident. In most cases an ecologist can no more predict the consequences of the extinction of a given species than an airline passenger can assess the loss of a single rivet.</em></p>

			<p>Natural California runs on a logic that is often different from the one that botanical and human transplants have brought with them from abroad. And large swaths of undeveloped California are populated with all variety of tarweeds, because tarweeds have that logic in their DNA.</p>

			<p>For Bruce Baldwin, one of the world’s leading experts on tarweeds and editor of the <em>Jepson Manual</em>, the California plant enthusiast’s Bible, the first step in teaching an appreciation for tarweeds is to teach an appreciation for the unique features of the state. There are something like 90 tarweed species, all of which evolved from a single common ancestor in what botanists call the “California floristic province” -- a global biodiversity hotspot for plants. The Livermore tarweed is limited to a particular habitat within that province, growing only in relatively rare alkali grasslands and meadows on the edge of barren “scalds” and vernal pools. Its setting, and the blazing late-summer day I went to look for it, are proof of its suitability; while other plants wither away in September after months of dry heat, the Livermore tarweed cheerfully blooms.</p>

			<p>Baldwin grew up exploring around Arroyo Grande, in central California. He remembers the hills coming alive in the fall with the yellow flowers of grassland tarweed, <em>Deinandra increscens</em>. As a young botanist he became fascinated by the diversity of the tarweed tribe, and by its evolutionary origins in California. The common ancestor of the tarweeds probably lived in cooler, mid-elevation spots like its sister group, the common medicinal plant arnica. As California’s climate became drier and warmer, the tarweeds moved down the hill and spread out into all the different habitats they enjoy today. Perhaps because that radiation occurred recently, though, tarweeds are notoriously difficult to identify in the field. Baldwin teaches daylong courses solely on tarweed identification, and he says botanists are always hungry for more.</p>

			<p>Thin and soft-spoken, Baldwin is a legend in California botany -- “our generation’s Jepson,” Bartosh called him. Baldwin is the curator of the most respected collection of California plants on the planet, the editor of the definitive guidebook to California plants, and the first to describe a dozen plant species, among them the Livermore tarweed. Twenty years ago he invented a DNA technique for understanding molecular relationships between plants that is now widely used. His proof of concept was the tarweeds, making tarweeds “like, fruit fly special,” Krimmel told me, as a foundational case study. In 2000 Baldwin used his new method to show that one of the most charismatic conservation cases on the planet, the Hawaiian silversword, is a direct descendant of California tarweed.</p>

			<p>Livermore tarweed was first collected on August 31, 1966, in the same field I had been to see. The collector Robert Hoover, a Cal Poly professor, probably recognized that the plant was different, Baldwin says. But he didn’t act on it. Shortly after Hoover collected the tarweed, Jepson’s then-curator Rimo Bacigalupi took a look at the collection and appended a note: “Did not seem to match any thus far published species.” Bacigalupi also didn’t pursue it further. Another 30 years passed before Baldwin, who had by then become the Jepson Herbarium’s third-ever curator, was asked about it by a research associate. He couldn’t identify the plant, so he drove out to Livermore. The plant was still there. He collected seeds, and brought them back to the lab to grow them. He extracted DNA. When he ran the analysis, it was apparent that he had something unique. In a 1999 paper in the journal <em>Madroño</em>, Baldwin announced the species and named it <em>Deinandra bacigalupi</em> it after Bacigalupi. Naturally, when botanists realized it was a distinct species, they set off looking for more.</p>

			<p>And so, almost as soon as we realized the Livermore tarweed existed, we realized how tenuously it did so.</p>

			<p>Baldwin doesn’t make a moral case for conservation for the Livermore tarweed, because he has seen it under the microscope, fit it into the universe, and found it necessary. “We don’t have a big emotional connection to plants, as much as a furry critter,” Baldwin says. “But it’s important to realize that plants in some ways are more foundational in the ecosystem than furry critters.”</p>

			<p>Intellectually, most people would agree. But the law, I found, does not.</p>

			<h2>6. DISRESPECTED TARWEEDS</h2>

			<div class="conversation">
				<p><em>Livermore tarweed: I’m really actually very important!</em></p>

				<p><em>Universe: Sorry, I gave at the office.</em></p>
			</div>

			<p>The federal Endangered Species Act, which most of us think of us as safeguarding imperiled life of any kind, provides dramatically weaker protections for plants than it does for animals. Unlike animals, an endangered plant receives protection from the law only on federal land. If the very last federally endangered Livermore tarweed grows on your private property, you are free to bulldoze it to construct a stables. The government, one recent report says, spends 25 times more on the recovery of endangered animals than it does on endangered plants. Such unequal treatment, says California Native Plant Society soil ecologist Emily Roberson, might trace back to English common law: Animals move across the land, so they’re the property of the state. Plants grow on the land, so they’re private property.</p>

			<p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature “redlists,” the international standard for conservation status, show that even science prioritizes animals: there are three times as many animals as plants on the list. (Although it’s <em>really</em> the wrong end of the stick to be a fungus: IUCN scientists have evaluated <a href="http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/summarystats/2015-4_Summary_Stats_Page_Documents/2015_4_RL_Stats_Table_3a.pdf">60,000 animals</a>, <a href="http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/summarystats/2015-4_Summary_Stats_Page_Documents/2015_4_RL_Stats_Table_3b.pdf">21,000 plants</a>, and<em> 49 species</em> of “<a href="http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/summarystats/2015-4_Summary_Stats_Page_Documents/2015_4_RL_Stats_Table_3c.pdf">fungi and protists</a>.”)</p>

			<p>Since 2002, Roberson has directed a Native Plant Conservation Campaign meant to remedy the status of plants as “second class conservation citizens.” Her two main goals are to make the Endangered Species Act stronger for plants, and to increase funding for federal plant staff. “There is no one to whom I have explained this problem with the Endangered Species Act that has said anything other than, ‘That’s crazy,’” Roberson told me. “Congressional staff, scientists, environmentalists who are not plant people, climate activists, wilderness and wildlife people, even conservatives. It makes no sense to anybody.”</p>

			<p>Anybody can appreciate Roberson’s petition. And yet, Roberson says, no one expects action. The petition is more an attempt to succor botanists as they wait for cultural change. “How we feel about an animal affects its survival,” <em>Wild Ones</em> author Jon Mooallem says in a <a href="http://blog.ted.com/the-strange-story-of-the-teddy-bear-jon-mooallem-at-ted2014/">2014 Ted Talk</a>; right now Americans simply don’t feel that way -- or realistically, any way at all -- about plants. “Plants in general play a very negligible role in the public discourse about extinction,” says Ursula Heise, a professor at UCLA’s Institute of the Environment who’s working on a book about cultural values and extinction. “Biodiversity conservation is at bottom a cultural and political issue, not a scientific one.”</p>

			<p>A surprising amount of cultural bias enters into our thinking about plants, and so into our laws for and attitudes toward their conservation. For example, says UC Santa Cruz emeritus professor of botany Lincoln Taiz, we tend to think of plants, particularly flowering plants, as feminine. (And vice-versa; Heise points out that Western literature with its “my love is like a red red rose” has exhausted the floral metaphors for women.) It took scientists in the Age of Enlightenment more than a century to discover pollination, which Taiz argues is because they simply couldn’t believe that a flower -- so obviously female -- could have male parts. Taiz and his wife Lee, who are working on a book on the subject of plant sex, have traced this attitude back to at least the Paleolithic and our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The Greeks, he says, associated action with men and passivity with women; they thought plants were passive and so idealized them as feminine. The Greeks influenced the scientists, which is why the scientists argued for 150 years about whether flowers could actually have male reproductive parts. Theophrastus, the Greek student of Aristotle who many consider the father of botany, declared in his <em>Enquiry Into Plants</em>, “Any plant always appears to be, as indeed it is, more comely and more perfect when it makes new growth, blooms, and bears fruit.”</p>

			<p>It’s probably no coincidence that the rare plant that stirs protective feeling is the damsel in distress. The Baker’s larkspur, the last plant added to the California endangered species list, is one such fragile beauty, with royal purple flowers that cascade down a luxuriant forest-green stem. Larkspur <em>is</em> a Cinderella story: an overlooked and imperiled rare plant, its beauty threatened by a hostile outside world.</p>

			<p>What is the tarweed’s story? It’s not heroic epic. It’s not buddy comedy. It’s also not tragedy, says Ursula Heise, because tragedy can’t happen to expendables. It’s not elegy, which we do write for beloved animals, and might write for a tree, but wouldn’t consider for a weed. “There’s something insidious about the narrative template,” Heise says. “Narratives are indispensable tools in relating to nature, but they also block out certain parts of it.”</p>

			<p>When Heath Bartosh and his wife were first dating, he wanted to convince her that California native plants were something interesting. He thought about it carefully and selected, for her introduction to botanizing, <em>Fritilaria</em> -- “the chocolate lily.” It’s “kind of weird” to go looking for native plants, Bartosh agrees. But once you’re out there, the plant -- even the chocolate lily -- fades necessarily into its setting. “Being out there, it’s more about seeing a place,” Bartosh told me. “It’s more about thinking about time, and looking at the plants and thinking about the time they’ve been there evolving, or how they got there.”</p>

			<p>The Germans, Ursula Heise told me, don’t have a direct equivalent to the Endangered Species Act. Instead they have an act animated by the preservation of <em>Landschaft</em>, landscape -- which, Heise says, includes human-transformed landscape. “You protect species so as to preserve these landscapes,” she says. Norway has a “Nature Diversity Act” that protects rare habitats in addition to rare species. Ecuador and Bolivia have tied biodiversity to indigenous cosmology and enshrined conservation in their constitutions. Native Californians encouraged tarweed growth as part of a productive grassland ecosystem.</p>

			<p>You might always find the Livermore tarweed itself valueless, yet appreciate it as a functioning piece in an exceedingly rare landscape. “I guess I ended up developing a soft spot for tarplants,” Bartosh says. “When everything else is out there is dry, you can come into places where you see big swaths of yellow. I’d love to see the city adopt Livermore tarplant as its official plant.”</p>

			<p>And here is one more quick story I’d like to tell you about the Livermore tarweed. That field we’ve been standing in for an hour -- the city owns it. Livermore controls the land on which grows the last of the Livermore tarweed.</p>

			<p>So what’s the problem?</p>

			<p>Bartosh laughs. The city is considering digging up the land so it can construct wetland habitat for endangered red-legged frogs.</p>
